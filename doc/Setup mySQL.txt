Setup mySQL like this:

Windows:
	Download the Community-Version Installer from: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/
	(not the web-community installer)
	You can download the 32-bit Installer, it will automatically install the 64-bit binaries
	
	During the installation, select "Custom" and install
		-mySQL Server
		-Connector/J
	
	On the next screen, apply the following configurations:
		Config Type: Server Machine
		TCP/IP, port 3306
		Open Firewall port for network access
	
	On the next screen, choose a secure root password
	and create a few account (you can add/remove accounts later)
	
	On the next screen, make sure mySQL will run as a Windows service
	on system startup
	
	Skip all following steps
	
Ubuntu:
	sudo apt-get install mysql-server
	Find out by yourself, how to configure it.
	Now, install the mySQL Connector/J manually.
	
Create database and start using it:
	create database db_name;
	use db_name;
	
Create user and grant access to all commands:
	CREATE USER user_name IDENTIFIED BY 'user_pass'; 
	grant usage on *.* to user_name@localhost identified by 'sqluserpw'; 
	grant all privileges on db_name.* to user_name@localhost; 
	
Create table:
	create table table_name (colum1_name data_type [constraints], colum2_name data_type [constraints]);
	
	The data_type can be:
		char(size)			String of fixed size
		varchar(maxsize)	String of variable size
		number(size,d)		Number with maximum number of digits on the left and right side of the comma
		date				Date.
		int					Integer.
	
	The constraints can be:
		unique: 		There can't be two entries with the same value
		not null: 		The entry can't be empty
		primary key:	Defines a unique identifier of each record
		auto_increment:	When setting the value to "default" it will take the next higher value

Insert entries:
	INSERT INTO table_name values (default, 'test', 'test', 'test);
	
Modify entries:
	UPDATE table_name SET colum_name = value WHERE colum_name = value;
